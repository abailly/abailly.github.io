<h1>Programming is not Reading</h1>

<ul>
<li>Laura Salvino’s talk at ncrafts drawing on the analogy between learning a new (human) language and learning a programming language</li>
<li>emphasizing reading software -&gt; simplicity, patterns, focusing on readers</li>
<li>do we really “want readable code” ? Reading code and making your code readable is good, and probably better than writing confusing, idiosyncratic, symbols-ladden code, but emphasizing readibility misses the point of software</li>
<li>Analogies are useful tools to think but we should be wary about carrying them too far: Programming languages are not human languages and their inner logic is totally different. A programming language is not a passive thing, it is active
<ul>
<li>I remember a tech leader in a team I worked with that each day printed the code written by the team and carried it home for review</li>
<li>What’s a the usefulness of online code review tools? Does anybody do serious reviews using Github diffs? It is much more useful to have the code locally, making sure it compiles (on <em>my</em> machine) and I can play with it</li>
<li>We spend a lot of times trying to find <em>the</em> right name for a function, a class, a method, a concept…</li>
<li>We refactor, rename, use complex patterns in names to ensure people will understand us</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Programs is mostly useful for execution: I don’t care a program is perfectly readable if it is incorrect. I would rather have a program which is awkwardly written, with terse variable names but is working correctly and “as expected”. To really understand a program means executing it which can be done in your head but is much more efficiently done with a REPL/Compiler/IDE</li>
<li>Words and sentences are not checkable by a computer which makes their usefulness as parts of a program limited. Comments are a major PITA…</li>
<li><a href>Living Documentation</a> is hard</li>
<li>See <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/literate-programming">this post</a> about Literate Programming: LP is a great idea that did not came to maturity because it has been stuck into primitive state and with a focus on <em>reading</em> instead of <em>running</em></li>
<li>Related to a lot of work going on in the <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">notebooks space</a>, innovative and/or extensible IDEs and <a href="https://awelonblue.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/introducing-wikilon/">Languages</a>, <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!2/LadderOfAbstraction">interactive</a> web <a href="http://tomasp.net/coeffects/">environments</a></li>
<li>Also noteworthy is the work on <a href>Type-Driven Development</a> and programming s a <em>refinement process</em> or <em>dialog</em> between humans and computers, like in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00155">Live functional programming with typed holes</a> and the <a href="https://hazel.org/">Hazel</a> programming environment</li>
