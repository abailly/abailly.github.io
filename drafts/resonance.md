Resonance is the harmonics of social bonds we weave with beings and things, whether objects, practices, beliefs, groups).
  * Maximising resonance vs. maximising lived experiences
  * Resonating bonds vs. alienation
  * Command & control vs. mimetic assimilation

### Skin is our first communication medium

It's first through touch and being touched that we experience the world, following the eerie state of the baby in his or her mother's placenta. The skin is a membrane and the outside affects us through it (scars, burns, strokes, tatoos) but we also express ourselves through (flush, goose bumps). The more we consider our skin (and body) as an _object_ the less we seem able to resonate.

###

Breathing and blowing are our very first, mostly unconscious, interaction with the world, ones which force us to let it penetrate us. Then comes eating and drinking.

### Sociality of the body

We are social beings through and through even within our bodily interaction with the world: The way we walk, we perceive space, our attitude, how we stand up and sit down... This _hexis_ is the embodiment of socially built constraints and habits and in return it has social effects.

### Erotic relationship and resonance

The erotic relationship to the other, whether "purely" sexual or "merely" platonic, is a peak of resonance. It's one of the most powerful and intense ways to resonate with the Other and the World as it involves every part of our being, physical, mental, aesthetic.

### Structure of relation with the World

Relation to the World can be modelled as involving 3 parts: The Self, the Body and the World.
The Body mediates the relationship of the Self to the World, and interactions happen in both directions yielding 4 different relations. Any of these relations can be experienced as _resonating_ or _muted_. In the late modernity, the Body (and the World) are most often experienced as _instrumental_.

### Two sides of reification of the Body

Reification is the process through which one aims at controlling and mastering the Body, considering it as an _object_. It can take two apparently opposite but deeply connected shapes:

* _Internal reification_ through reeducation and training, dietary regimes, yoga and gym courses, fasting...
* _External reification_ through the use drugs or aesthetical surgery.

Reification induces _alienation_ by dissociating one Self from her Body, a symptom of which being the _burn-out_.

### Sexuality

The separation between the _objectal body_ and the _subjectal body_, between the body as it relates to the world and the body as it relates to the Self, is nowhere as obvious than in the varieties of sexuality and relationships to one's gender. The fact that intersexuality, travesty, homosexuality or transsexuality can be powerful sources of alienation and pain for the individual demonstrates:
  1.  How much society values the _objectal body_ over the _subjectal_ one, and
  2.  That such fundamental things as our perceptions of our body are socially built.

### Resonance is not desire

The deepest experiences of resonances are always devoid of a particular object hence of desire.

Man is an auto-interpretative being.

### Elementary forms of cultural relations to the World

According to Weber and Habermas, each culture favors one or the other form of relation to the worlds, classified along 2 pairs of opposition: Active or Passive attitude, whereby the Self is an intentional subject actively engaging with the World, or merely a receptacle of whatever the World throws at her ; Affirmation or Negation as ways to evaluate one's relationship to the world.

|             | Active                    | Passive                        |
| Affirmation | Adaptation (Confucianism) | Contemplation (Ancient Greece) |
| Negation    | Domination (Capitalism)   | Escape (hinduism, buddhism)    |

### Weak and Strong Evaluation

Evaluation is the process through which we attribute one or more _values_ to something.
We can distinguish between _Weak evaluation_ which relates to our immediate desires, "I want X" and which are "internal"; and _Strong evaluation_ which relates to our core values, "It is important that X", and which are always external, within the _World_.

Evaluation allows to build a _Moral map_ of the World with guides our choices and gives meaning.

### Basic Existential Problems

[Gerhard Schulze](http://www.gerhardschulze.de/) studied the attitudes and beliefs of inhabitants of a small German city in the 80's and proposed 5 classes identifiying each attitude with what he calls a _Basic Existential Problem_:

1. _Threat_ where the World is perceived mostly as a source of danger from which to seek protection,
2. _Trial_: The world is a source of challenges to overcome,
3. _Stimulation_: The World is a source of feelings and sensations,
4. _Self experience_: The world is a way to know oneself better,
5. _Adaptation_: The World as expectations to be met, to adapt with.

#### Biological Roots of Resonance

Empathy is a biological phenomenon that we have been programmed to feel, much like as social animals we have a natural tendency to imitate others. That's why it's pretty hard to act violently in normal circumstances, it requires exceptional situations and possibly several agressions to react.

Empathy has a neurological support, possibly through so-called mirror neurons and imitative instinct, but it is socially constructed through the child and adult's interactions with others. "Wolf child" unvoluntary experiments and numerous psychological studies have proven that interactions are vital for the mental well-being and psychic development.

#### Language and Resonance

Saying or hearing can be performative because language is intimately linked to our capabilities to resonate. And language resonates because it links us to the social world.

#### Alienation vs. Resonance

Alienation is a concept which has received a lot of attention along the 20th century, so much so that it devolved towards amorphous meaninglessness. Within the theory of resonance, alienation can receive a very precise definition as _relation without relationship_ to the World, that is a form of being and interaction with the world, both things, animals and people, which is purely _instrumental_, muted, devoid of feedback.

That's the exact opposite of _resonance_ which is defined as a bi-directional, feedback rich, relation to the World, each party resonating with the others on its _own frequency_.

Alienation and resonance are dialectically related: Resonance emerges from consciousness of an alienation and the quest of a "solution" founded on trust into the very possibility of resonance.
