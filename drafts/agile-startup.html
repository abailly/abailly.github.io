<h1>Building an Agile distributed startup</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on October 26, 2015</div>

<h1 id="planning">Planning</h1>
<ul>
<li>We used <a href="http://taiga.io">taiga.io</a> to plan the golive, with spring planning. It was a good thing to explain to non-tech people we can deliver so much in a period.</li>
<li>Used 1 week sprints</li>
<li>Took us a while to get to some form of regularity and cadence, never really get to smooth release and meaningful SP values</li>
<li>People are having a hard time understanding SP, and when they understand they start trying to game it and discuss evaluations -&gt; quickly get back to “when will it be done?” and “can’t we really do it faster?” and “what if we did XX?” questions</li>
<li>People also had a hard time using taiga (and I am not sure it would have been better with any other tool…): response is a bit slow, most of the things don’t make sense for them, they don’t follow really tickets and comments on them… nor do they care much about tracking SPs progress</li>
<li>a month or so after go-live we switched to a kanban style process which is not really well supported by taiga</li>
<li>we dropped formal estimates, even before golive: what’s done is done, when it is not done it is not done. Coping with unrealistic expectations and requirements -&gt; make everything visible, deploy very quickly and allow people to test easily, work in short steps</li>
<li>We don’t provide estimates anymore, and people don’t ask for them, except in very broad terms</li>
<li>Switched to using plain trello:
<ul>
<li>“everybody” knows it, very intuitive to pick</li>
<li>is super-fast and reactive</li>
<li>provides nearly all the features we need (except swimlanes but we use tags instead)</li>
<li>available on a wide variety of platforms</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We use 2 boards:
<ul>
<li>one for day-to-day work, contains baby step features + bugs, from “Todo” to “Deployed in production”</li>
<li>one for roadmapping, contains 3-months columns with coarse-grained features</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pair-programming">Pair Programming</h1>
<ul>
<li>Remote pairing works ok (if the network has no hiccup…)
<ul>
<li>setup a remote VM containing dev environment</li>
<li>connect with ssh + tmux</li>
<li>use hangout for voice + video (tip: set your terminal to be slightly transparent so that you can see the remote persons behind the code)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is more exhausting than face to face pairing, requires more focus and engagement from all parties to avoid miscommunications</li>
<li>timezone differences makes <em>Deferred Pairing</em> useful: Someone starts some work, uses <a href="http://slack.com">slack</a> as a stream of consciousness, then pushes result. Someone else in another timezone can then pick up work</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="on-being-remote">On Being Remote</h1>
<ul>
<li>Great post about <em>Remote First</em> culture: http://zachholman.com/posts/remote-first/</li>
<li>Counter-example: Organisations with a handful of offices, working distributedly. Distribution was an afterthought, something that came up as a constraint because of mergers, and no amount of tooling can make that kind of culture work</li>
</ul>
