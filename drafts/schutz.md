> Sociology is a science concerning itself with the interpretive understanding of social action and thereby with a causal explanation of its consequences. We shall speak of "action" insofar as the acting individual attaches a subjective meaning to his behaviour. Action is "social" insofar as its subjective meaning takes into account the behaviour of others an is thereby oriented in its course"
> _Economy and Society_, M.Weber, vol.1, p.4, UC Press, 2013 (1978)
