# Pair Programming

* Remote pairing works ok (if the network has no hiccup...)
    * setup a remote VM containing dev environment
    * connect with ssh + tmux
    * use hangout for voice + video (tip: set your terminal to be slightly transparent so that you can see the remote persons behind
      the code)
* It is more exhausting than face to face pairing, requires more focus and engagement from all parties to avoid miscommunications
* timezone differences makes *Deferred Pairing* useful: Someone starts some work, uses [slack](http://slack.com) as a stream of
  consciousness, then pushes result. Someone else in another timezone can then pick up work
