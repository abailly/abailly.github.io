<h1>Anatomy of a Haskell-based Startup</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on October 26, 2015</div>

<p>This is the first post of a series I am planning to write about my experience developing software at <a href="http://www.capital-match.com">Capital Match</a>, a Singapore-based startup providing a peer-to-peer lending marketplace for Small and Medium Businesses and private and corporate investor.</p>
<p>This post is about the design and architecture of the system itself, the choices and tradeoffs that were made, whether good or bad. In the conclusion I try to provide an assessment of the current situation and reflect on those choices.</p>
<h1 id="fundamental-design-choices">Fundamental Design Choices</h1>
<h2 id="haskell">Haskell</h2>
<p>Haskell is a fay that has been leaning over Capital Match’s cradle since the beginning. Using it was an obvious choice for me, even if I had had limited professional experience with Haskell before that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell is a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/">very mature language</a> with a <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">state-of-the-art compiler</a> that receives constant attention from a bunch of extremely bright people and thus keeps improving and evolving,</li>
<li>Haskell’s tools for building robust web-based applications is not as mature as what you can find in Java or .Net worlds but it is evolving quickly as the platform is gaining traction thanks to efforts from both a vibrant <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_Communities_and_Activities_Report">community</a> and few but dedicated <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell">private bodies</a>,</li>
<li>Haskell developers are few and far between, but their number is growing and they are more often than not passionate and talented.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="event-sourcing">Event Sourcing</h2>
<p>The system was designed from the onset as an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event-sourced</a> application: The source of truth in the system is a sequence of <em>events</em> where each event defines a transition between two states. At any point in time, the state of the system is thus whatever state the current sequence of events leads to. Among the motivations behind using ES are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having fun and explore this space of the design instead of going for the more traditional RDBMS-based web app,</li>
<li>Auditability and traceability of all actions impacting data on the platform, a property which is highly-desirable in a bank-like system. I have had previous exposure to finance software and they all end up implementing some journalling system to trace users actions and data changes,</li>
<li>reluctance to add the operational burden of maintaining a RDBMS as part of the system. We could have used SaaS relational (or non-relational) database to remove that burden but this implies using yet another tool, learning some other piece of technology, using some set of drivers with specific bugs and requirements,</li>
<li>personal bias against RDBMS<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Simplicity of implementation, at least when you don’t require HA, partition tolerance or more generally fault-tolerance: A single file to which all events are appended is enough, and this is exactly what we do,</li>
<li>Languages mpedance mismatch. There is the tradional <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch">Object-relational Impedance Mismatch</a> although <a href="http://blog.jooq.org/2015/08/26/there-is-no-such-thing-as-object-relational-impedance-mismatch/">some have argued</a> it is not where we usually think it is. As argued in the latter I think the real issue is in SQL: SQL is (probably) great for writing complex queries<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> but not so much for inserting data.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>
<p>The main interface to the system is a REST-like API providing various resources and actions over those resources. Most exchanges with the outside world are done using JSON representation of resources, with some CSV. The <em>User Interface</em> is merely a client of the API and is (morally if not to the letter) a single page application. There is also a command-line client which offers access to the complete API and is used for administrative purpose.</p>
<h2 id="models">Models</h2>
<p>The core of the application is purely functional and made of several loosely coupled <code>BusinessModel</code> instances (think Aggregates in DDD parlance) that each mainting consistency over specific sub-domains: <code>Accounting</code> manages accounts and transactions, <code>Facility</code> manages facilities lifecycle, <code>Investor</code> and <code>Borrower</code> manage profiles and roles-dependent data, <code>User</code> manages basic registration, authentication and settings for users (e.g. features)…</p>
<p>A <code>BusinessModel</code> is defined as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">BusinessModel</span> a <span class="kw">where</span>
  <span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Event</span><span class="ot"> a ::</span> <span class="fu">*</span>
  <span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Command</span><span class="ot"> a ::</span> <span class="fu">*</span>
<span class="ot">  init ::</span> a
<span class="ot">  act ::</span> <span class="dt">Command</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Event</span> a
<span class="ot">  apply ::</span> <span class="dt">Event</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a  <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>A type of events this model generates</li>
<li>A type of commands this model can process</li>
<li>An initial value for the model</li>
<li>A pair of functions describing which event is generated by a command <em>acting</em> on the model and how an event changes the model when it is <em>applied</em> to it</li>
</ul>
<p>The state of each BusinessModel instance is computed upon application startup by loading all the events and applying each stored event to an <code>init</code>ialised model. Models are then kept in memory while events are stored persistently. This initial startup process takes a couple of seconds given the small scale at which we operate.</p>
<p>Each model demarcates transactional boundaries and is the unit of consistency within the system. Commands and events on a single model are assumed to occur <em>sequentially</em>.</p>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>Above <code>BusinessModel</code>s are <code>Service</code>s which provides the interface to the system. Services orchestrate the interactions of one or more Models. At the simplest level, a <code>Service</code> simply consists in the application of a single <code>Command</code> on some <code>BusinessModel</code>, but it can be more complex, synchronizing application of commands over several models. Based on the ideas exposed in <a href="http://adrianmarriott.net/logosroot/papers/LifeBeyondTxns.pdf">Life Beyond Distributed Transactions</a>, a Service represents the state of the interaction between a single user of the system, e.g. a request, and one or more piece of data maintained by the system.</p>
<p>Because they are the agents of the outside world in the system, Services operates in an impure context, hence in a dedicated <code>Monad</code> called <code>WebM</code> (more on this later). Services typically return some representable type, when they are queries, or an <code>Event</code> denoting the outcome of the request.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have this hierarchy of monads, expressed in types:
<ul>
<li><code>model :: Command -&gt; State Model (Event Model)</code></li>
<li><code>service :: WebM (Event Model)</code></li>
<li><code>web :: ActionT ()</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This hierarchy of monads delineates languages:
<ul>
<li>language of models expresses atomic (e.g. often CRUDesque) changes to a Model, like <code>RegisterTransaction</code>, <code>UpdateProfile</code> or <code>CloseFacility</code></li>
<li>language of Services expresses either direct changes to Models or more complex interactions like <code>addPledge</code> or <code>acceptFacility</code> which require more than one command to complete.</li>
<li>language of Web manages HTTP Requests and resposnes, JSON structures and delegate work to services. It is the language of representation of things</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="managing-state">Managing State</h2>
<ul>
<li>WebM is a monad with IO inside, so it is stateful. It has access to 2 pieces of state:
<ul>
<li><code>LocalState</code> is filled with information relevant to a single query (e.g. user id, request id, time…)</li>
<li><code>SharedState</code> is a <code>TVar</code> (transaction variable living in <code>STM</code> monad) that is shared across all requests.</li>
<li>STM transactions operate at the level of a single <code>Command</code> through the <code>applyCommand</code> function<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li><code>applyCommand</code> is the critical part of the system, it is responsible for:
<ul>
<li>applying the command and updating the stored Model</li>
<li>persist the event in the “database”</li>
<li>dispatch the event to interested components</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Here is the definition of WebM: <code>.haskell   newtype WebStateM g l m a = WebStateM { runWebM :: TVar g -&gt; l -&gt; m a }</code></li>
<li>This is actually a <code>Reader</code> monad with two different pieces of data. The <code>l</code> component is the local state which is set for each request and the <code>g</code> part is the global state, shared through a STM-controlled variable</li>
<li>Executing a user-triggered action is in a sense a series of translations occuring between the different <em>level of languages</em>:
<ul>
<li>from REST to <code>WebM</code> we use <code>inWeb :: WebStateM CapitalMatchState LocalState m a -&gt; ActionT e (WebStateM CapitalMatchState   LocalState m) a</code></li>
<li>from <code>WebM</code> to <code>STM Model</code> we use <code>liftIO . atomically</code></li>
<li>… and finally in <code>Model</code> we reach the pure kernel of the domain!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h1>
<ul>
<li>Concurrency is mostly handled at the REST layer through Warp and Scotty: Each request is handled concurrently by separate threads which are <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/LightweightConcurrency">very lightweight in Haskell/GHC</a></li>
<li>On top of that we have a couple more threads in the application:
<ul>
<li>one logging thread per handler (currently 2), which handle logging messages</li>
<li>a storage thread which handle low-level read/write requests to events file</li>
<li>a driver thread which handle events storage<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>a <em>Heartbeat</em> thread periodically checks other threads and notifies health</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We used to run directly threads with <code>forkIO</code> and friends but finally moved to something simpler and robust <a href="http://hackage.org/packages/async">async</a> package.</li>
<li>Concurrent updates to the model are handled through <a href="http://hackage.org/packages/stm">Software Transactional Memory</a>: A <code>TVar</code> (transactional variable) holds a reference to the state</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="persistence-and-storage">Persistence and Storage</h1>
<ul>
<li>Persistence is managed through a dedicated event bus: <code>Event</code> are first packaged into a more opaque <code>StoredEvent</code> object containing metadata useful for traceability of the system:
<ul>
<li>an event version (more on this later)</li>
<li>an event type which encodes at the value level the actual type of event</li>
<li>a timestamp (in UTC)</li>
<li>ID of user generating the event</li>
<li>ID of original request</li>
<li>SHA1 of commit, e.g. version of the code (thanks to <a href="http://geoffroycouprie.com/">Geoffroy Couprie</a> for the suggestion)</li>
<li>a <code>ByteString</code> containing serialized version of the event</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then <code>StoredEvent</code>s are pushed to a dedicated <code>Driver</code> thread which stores events in the underlying events file</li>
<li>There is a loophole here: if storage of event fails, we have still applied event to the model! To make things simple if storage fail we “Stop the world” assuming that if we have an I/O error it’s irrecoverable and we better stop here</li>
<li>This is crude and does not provide strong guarantees on durability of data, but in practice it has worked pretty well, probably thanks to low volume of traffic</li>
<li>Storage is a simple append-only file which contains sequence of applied events serialized to some binary format (Kafka-like)</li>
<li>We are in the process of moving to a much more robust storage solution:
<ul>
<li>externalize data store to another process/host</li>
<li>replicate it to increase fault-tolerance</li>
<li>provide strong consistency through distributed consensus</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="user-interface">User Interface</h1>
<ul>
<li>UI code still lives partly in the server and partly as pure client-side code:
<ul>
<li>HTML code is generated and served by the server using standard endpoints according to <code>Accept</code> header in request. We use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-html">blaze-html</a> combinators to describe the pages in Haskell</li>
<li>Static assets are served by <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-middleware-static">wai-middleware-static</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>But the grunt of UI work is done on the client with <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om/">Om</a>. Om is a <a href="http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">clojurescript</a> interface to Facebook’s <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. We treat the UI-backend interaction as a pure client-server: UI maintains its own state and interact with server through usual Ajax calls, updating state accordingly. The interface a user sees is a single-page application</li>
<li>None of the developer in the core team is a web designer or developer by trade so our UI is functional but a bit boring and cluttered.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="logging-and-monitoring">Logging and Monitoring</h1>
<ul>
<li>There is a <code>Log</code> structure which is a queue consuming logging events and handling it according to some IO function</li>
<li>We log all queries, all commands issued and various other events occuring in the system: application startup/stop, heartbeat, I/O errors, storage events…</li>
<li>One log handler outputs JSON-formatted events to <code>stdout</code></li>
<li>One log handler outputs some events to <a href="http://riemann.io">Riemann</a>, using <a href="https://github.com/tel/riemann-hs">riemann-hs</a>. Those events are then used for notification and monitoring of infrastructure (more on this in a later post)</li>
<li>At startup of application we also notify dev team by sending an email with the configuration. This is useful to check startup of production environment, as this email contains among other things the version of the application and the command line with which is has been started</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="future-works">Future Works</h1>
<h2 id="towards-microservice">Towards Microservice</h2>
<ul>
<li>In spite of good initial intention we still have built a monolith, albeit a small one and one that will be not too hard to split. We now want to increase robustness, resilience and scalability of our development process and our system by breaking the monolith into components services</li>
<li>We are in the process of splitting the application into smaller constituents along the following lines:
<ul>
<li>Glue code to wire things together,</li>
<li>Support code</li>
<li>One component per group of related services,</li>
<li>One component per “Model”, possibly clustered</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ideally each component should be deployable independently or alongside other components in the same process depending on needed granularity and redundancy. This can be achieved easily through configuration at the level of the glue code according to some topology configuration</li>
<li>we are not currently too much constrained by performance bounds: response time is pretty much acceptable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information-hiding">Information Hiding</h2>
<ul>
<li>We expose too much of the internal details of modules and types</li>
</ul>
