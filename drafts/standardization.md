# Why standardize development environment?

- Standardization initially emerged in factories as a way to _increase_ both production and productivity.
  - standardizing output means higher utilisation of machines and resources as there is no adaptation time between "batches", no cost of change
  - Standardizing work also means interchangeable workers which means pressure on wages which means increased profits
- after WWII and the work of [Edward Deming](https://deming.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/On-Statistical-Techniques-in-Industry-as-a-Natural-Resource-1952.pdf)  and [Toyota](https://global.toyota/en/company/vision-and-philosophy/production-system/), _standardization of process_ was recognized as a key to _decrease variation_ while _increasing variety_
- standardization of process enables continuous improvement: It's impossible to improve if there is no common understanding of what the current situation is, what are the things to improve and how to explore improvements options.
- just as Lean Production seeks to improve the production process, Lean Product Development seeks to improve the development process which implies a need for standardization of this development process.
- but whereas Lean Production's standardization goal is to _control variation_ in output and process, Lean Development's standardization goal is to _control complexity_ in output process
- among intellectual and creative workers, and especially among developers, standardization is often perceived as antagonist to creativity
  - There is a long standing tradition of individualism and idiosyncratic customisation of one's own machine among the developers crowd. From hardware to keyboard shortcuts through keyboards, operating systems, terminal shells, editors or IDEs, developers love to patiently and carefully craft their environment to their liking. This is inline with the traditional heroic view of coding: The [10x programmer](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/the-origins-of-the-10x-developer-2e0177ecef60) is still a vivid myth, even though it's [devoid of any scientific basis](https://leanpub.com/leprechauns), and the capability to customize the development environment is often viewed as a key aspect of a developer's productivity[^3].
- Ninety-nine percent of software is produced by teams of engineers, product managers, subject matter experts, and designers.
- There is more and more software writtend and deployed, and the volume of code produced is growing super-linearly
- Controlling complexity, both the complexity of the software the produce and the software they use, is nowadays one of the main task of software developement teams
- therefore, standardization of the development environment is necessary to tame the complexity of the developed software
- this was recognized as a key practice by eXtreme Programming in the form of _Collective Code Ownership_ and _Coding Standards_
- standardization does not curb creativity in software programming for the same reason or from the same arguments that standardizing on a 26 (or 32) letters alphabet, or using only a limited palette of colors, or 56 keys of a piano, never prevented anyone from writing, painting, drawing, playing or composing music…
