At the time I write this article, _Intersectionality_ has attracted much attention of mainstream media and public opinion, as protests against racism and "legal violence" perpetrated by police and law enforcement officers are raging across most of Western world. But reading an article in a French newspaper I got confused by what the concept and the word attached to it really meant as it is used to designate the _union_ of various movements fighting against subordination: anti-racism, feminism, LGBT... Coming from a computer science background where set theory is much used and studied, it seemed to me that conflating both concepts of _intersection_ and _union_ could only led to confusion and void the mere concept behind the word, depriving it of any substance and turning it into a placeholder, a meme.

In effort to clarify my thoughts on this topic, I went on reading the seminal paper written by [Kimberl√© W. Crenshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Williams_Crenshaw) on the concept of Intersectionality: [Mapping the margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color](https://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/mapping-margins.pdf). This is my attempt at summarising and understanding this article and what intersectionality actually means.

# Summary

The article is introduces the concept of intersectionality focusing on the particular situation of women of color, who are at the _intersection_ of two strands of subordination or oppression: Racism, or the subordination of non-white people to white people ; and patriarchy, or the subordination of women to men. She doesn't specifically explore the social subordination dimension, only hinting at this particular aspect from time to time, but this is background assumption of most of the examples and analysis she provides. She details the specific situation of black women, more precisely how black women's specific position at the _intersection_ of two dominated _groups_ adversely affects their lives and makes them prime targets of domestic violence, rape and abuse.

## Overview

The article goes through various examples and "case studies" to cover various aspects of intersectionality:
* _Structural_, or how the position of women of color impacts their lives,
* _Political_, or how the specific issues faced by women of color are missed by existing non-intersectional politics,
* and _Representational_, or how the dominant cultural representation of women of color ignores their particular location and challenges.

The thesis defended by K.Crenshaw and illustrated through each case and example can be summarised as:
1. Women of color have to endure two different forms of subordination and discrimination, along (at least) two dimensions, their gender as women and thus subordinated to men, and their race as black or colored persons and thus subordinated to white people,
2. Those two dimensions do not only add to each other, they compound and produces _instances of subordination_ that are markedly different from those of endured by non-colored women or black men, ie. by people who are subordinated only on one dimension,
3. Groups and policies that fight along only one of those dimensions end up failing to cater for the specific needs of people at their intersection,
4. This failure, in return, negatively impacts those policies and is not conducive to further identity politics goal.

## Examples & Cases

### Battered Women

* Immigration laws that try to fight marriage fraud have been amended, under the pressure from anti-racist and progressist groups, so that spouses who are subject to domestic violence are waived from sanction and can receive help. However, those women which are subject to a violent spouse are also, more often than not, non-English speaking and non-white, which makes it harder for them to report to the police or engage in trials ; moreover, being socially at the bottom of the ladder means they usually live in crowded apartments, under direct scrutiny of their relatives and devoid of freedom.
* On the feminist side, she gives an example of a non-profit providing shelter to battered women in NYC that had as a policy to only accept English-speaking women, in order to better communicate with the support staff and other inmates, to the point they would reject application of latina women, even under the most pressing emergency. This organisation was lead by white feminist who failed to address and understand the specific needs of non-white or non-anglo women.
* A more subtle case is provided by campaigns against domestic violence which specifically target middle- and upper-class groups, conveying or reinforcing the message that domestic violence is to expected from the poor,
* On the antiracist side, black activists have fought against proposals to provide ethnic information on domestic violence statistics, under the premise that this would only serve to reinforce white stereotypes about black men being more violent,
* There's even antiracist thought leaders who explicitly endorse patriarchy as being a good thing for black people,

### Rape

High profile rape trials and anti-rapist policies provide other examples of both the antiracist and feminist approaches shortcomings when applied to black women's situation:
