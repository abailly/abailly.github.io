* How is it to age as a programmer?
* Typical corporate ladder involves at some point moving from technical positions to management, esp. true in France?
* Various possible technical roles to evolve: Architect, Staff engineer, Coach...
* What if one wants to keep building and delivering stuff, having his or her hands dirty?
* Political stance: Avoid being in a position of power, or subordinate to others
* Keep learning new stuff
  * new languages: Rust, Scheme
  * evolve and refine dev env
* Keep teaching stuff to others
* Learn to love legacy code and legacy langauges and environments
* Avoid being trapped with golden corporate handcuffs, eg. being a specialist of homegrown tech stack makes you useless everywhere else
  * happened to our parents in the 80s and 90s working in industry

* You know why you are here
  * That happened to me when I went back to University: I had better grades mostly because I was much more motivated than the vast majority of the other students
