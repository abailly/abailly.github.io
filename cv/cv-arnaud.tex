\roottitle{Summary}  % a root section title

\begin{multicols}{2}  % open a multicolumn environment
  I am an experienced technical lead, architect and software engineer with a proven track record of delivering business-focused high-quality solutions quickly and efficiently. I have a wide array of skills and knowledge in anything software-related with a particular focus on software engineering, language design and implementation, functional programming, automated testing and DevOps.

  I currently focus on finding novel and efficient ways to develop distributed and decentralized applications and systems, particularly looking into statically typed languages-based solutions like Haskell or Idris. I also have an interest in maintaining existing applications, whether using legacy or brand-new technologies.

  Strong team player and seasoned team leader, I am always on the look for better ways to collaboratively develop and maintain software stack, hence my decade-old interest in \emph{Agile development} theory and practice with a focus on actual coding techniques rather than organisational tools.
