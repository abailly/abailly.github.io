<h1 id="what-is-exploratory-testing">What is Exploratory Testing?</h1>
<p> &gt; Test design and test execution made at the same time where the outcome from your most recent test guide you what the next test will be. &gt; From <a href="http://www.sast.se/q-moten/2007/stockholm/q3/2007_q3_claesson.pdf"></a>  Also termed <a href="http://context-driven-testing.com/">Context Driven Testing</a>  # Try It to See if It Works  From <a href="http://www.satisfice.com/rst.pdf">Rapid Software Testing</a>  * <strong>Try It</strong>: Exercise different options, different procedures, combinations, arrangements, ways of doing things * <strong>See</strong>: Observe what’s going on (need Testability and Observability), get coverage of the software behaviour * <strong>It Works</strong>: Behaves as expected (eg. by the Specs), detect inconsistencies, omissions, blind spots  =&gt; Critical Thinking  # Test Charter  Test Charter 1: Analyze the copy/paste function of pictures Actor: Normal user Purpose: To evaluate if the copy/paste function of pictures works in our word processor together with the most commonly used word processors on the market (Word, Power Point., etc.) and other programs where pictures can be inserted in the copy buffer for copy/paste operations in the PC. The purpose is also to see that no information is lost or corrupted. Setup: A Dell PC with 2 Gb memory, our word processor, the Microsoft Office package professional and the home edition 2003 patch level xx, PDF reader version 7.1, Notepad version 4, Internet Explorer version 7, Opera version 5, Mozilla……etc. (the setup might be common for several charters and can therefore be described and referred to instead of repeating the same information in every charter). Priority: High, because this function is used very frequently both within our own word processor, but also between other word processors and programs, the user may want to copy/paste pictures with ours. www.enea.se Reference: Requirement abc_1 in document Def-07:034 revision R1.1. Risk number 3 from the risk assessment held on April 4 2007 regarding the copy function, which is documented and followed up in the document Rsk-07:012. Data: A variety of pictures with different resolutions, both vector graphics as well as bit mapped pictures. The pictures could be photos or figures in web browsers for example. Complex pictures are also included and pictures which might be copy protected in some way. Activities: 1. Copy/paste a picture in our word processor from one location to another in the same document. 2. Copy/paste a picture to and from our word processor into/from Word, PowerPoint and Excel. 3. Copy a picture into our word processor from a variety of the mostly used Web browsers. 4. Copy/paste a picture to/from the most commonly used web site building tools such as Dreamweaver from Adobe. 5. Copy a picture from a PDF document using Acrobat Reader into our word processor. 6. Try to copy a write protected picture from the web or other source into our word processor. 7. Try to copy/paste a variety of non readable and some readable ASCII-characters or corrupted pictures. A simple example of a test charter, continued…. Test Charter 1: Analyze the copy/paste function of pictures, continued…. Oracle notes:  Look if the size of the pasted picture changed on the screen (it should not).  Check if there is any loss in the resolution of the picture especially when you copy and paste from other programs to or from ours.  Check which is the highest resolution picture that can be copied and how that affect the system.  Check for memory leaks and how much memory the copy/paste operation takes from the system and how that affects the use of other programs. Other programs should not slow down or be affected in any way.  Print pasted pictures to see if there are any differences in color, resolution or any other anomaly. Variations:  Try out (and find) the boundaries of how large pictures are possible to copy/paste. www.enea.se  Perform copy/paste with a large number of items in the copy/paste buffer in your PC.  Try to fill the copy/paste buffer to its limit and then copy/paste a picture and see what happens.  Try the longest file name of the picture you can type before making the copy/paste. You may use the tool Perlclip (download from http://www.satisfice.com/tools/perlclip.zip) to generate file names with a million characters or more if you want.  # Taking Notes  Test coverage <What input data have I studied and given feedback on to improve its quality? Which reviews have I participated in? How much have I covered in my test execution and how much remain> www.enea.se Evaluation notes &lt;What have I learned so far by executing the test ideas/attempts for these specific functions? Does it seem stable? Have I found any faults? What test attempts am I going to do next based on my idea list and current observations&gt; Risk/Strategy list <Which risks have been covered and which ones remain among the most important ones? Which part of the initial test strategy should I follow and does it need any changes?> Test execution log <Any specific notes I would like to highlight in addition to the recordings made during the test execution> Issues, Questions and Anomalies &lt;Any strange behavior I don’t understand. Is there anything wrong with my test idea/test attempt, test environment, test data, misunderstanding of the function, test script or the system under test?&gt;  # References  * <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JohanHoberg/standardized-risks-charters-in-exploratory-testing">Standardizing Charters &amp; Risks</a>   # What</p>
