<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Lessons learned in Software Testing: A Context-driven approach</em>, Cem Kaner, James Bach and Brett Pettichord, Wiley, 2002</p>
<p>A in-depth exposition of testing, testers and test teams, complete from techniques and tools to project management and advices on how to communicate about bugs with developers. A must-read on the subject by leading experts on <em>exploratory testing</em>. <em>Context-driven</em> refers to a so-called <em>school of testing</em> which advocates flexible and smart testing practice: Tester is viewed as an educated expert, knowledgeable in a wide array of domains from development to system through functional understanding of the software, and not as a “script monkey”.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Agile Testing</em>, L.Crispin &amp; J. Gregory, Addison-Wesley, 2009</p>
A global overview of testing from an agile perspective, includes discussion on testing tools, techniques, practices and strategies from developer’s unit test to high-level exploratory testing and concerns for performance testing. Proposes classification of testing following Brian Marick’s <em>Quadrant</em> with 2 dimensions:
<ul>
<li>team-facing vs. business-facing,</li>
<li>supporting development vs. critiquing the product</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Specification by Example</em>, G.Adzic, Manning, 2012</p>
<p>Most recent book by one of the though leaders on agile testing. Focuses on the general problem of delivering the <em>right software</em> and meeting stakeholders and customers’ expectations. Contains lot of advices and case reports drawn from the author’s experience as a consultant worldwide. Also presents various tools and techniques for <em>functional testing</em> and expressing <em>executable specifications</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Performance by Design</em>, Menascé et al.</p>
<p>Not strictly on testing but deals in great details with what is performance, how to measure it, how to design systems to meet specific performance criteria, capacity planning. Contains theoretical materials on queueing theory and markov chains which form the basis foundation for systems performance analysis and planning, and case studies.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Art of software testing</em>, G.J. Myers, <em>Wiley</em>, 2004 (2nde édition) 1979 (1ère édition).</p>
<p>Classical book on software testing. Somewhat outdated but still contains good overview of basic testing problems and techniques.</p></li>
<li><em>Testing object-oriented systems</em>, R.V. Binder, <em>Addison Wesley</em>,</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2000" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Tentative coverage of everything related to testing from an object-oriented perspective. Exclusively focused on automated testing of OO and component-based systems, from unit level to systems level. Somewhat outdated on the technical side of things as tooling and understanding of unit-level testing has matured but also contains good coverage of test design techniques.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><em>A practical guide to testing OO software</em>, J.D. McGregor, D.A. Sykes, <em>Addison Wesley</em>, 2001.</p>
<p>Somewhat more legible version of the above.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Le test des logiciels</em>, Xanthakis et al., Hermès, 1998</p>
<p>Livre académique centré sur les tests dits boîtes blanches et les spécifications formelles appliquées au test. Couvre en détail les critères de couverture de tests structuraux.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sytematic Black-box Testing</em>, Boris Beizer, Prentice-Hall, 1993</p>
<p>Excellent coverage of tests analysis and design techniques from one of the pioneers on the field. Covers various forms of combinatorial techniques to design test suites and cases.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Un processus pour les Systèmes d’Informations</em>, P.Pezziardi et al., Octo Technology, 2006</p>
<p>Octo est une SSII réputée qui intervient sur l’ensemble des processus de gestion des systèmes d’informations d’entreprise, depuis la gestion stratégique de portefeuilles d’applications - Applications Portfolio Management - jusqu’à l’implémentation. Ce livre est un condensé des “meilleures pratiques” actuelles du développement dans le cadre de SI, très inspirée par les pratiques agiles. La partie consacrée au test et à la qualité du logiciel est toujours intéressante et offre un panorama pertinent du sujet.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Le test de logiciels</em>, ???, Vuibert, 2003</p>
<p>Un des rares livres en français sur le sujet, essentiellement axé sur la gestion de projets de tests pour des gros projets.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Practical Model-based Testing</em>, M.Utting et B.Legeard, Addison-Wesley, 2007</p>
<p>Model-based testing is an approach of testing that is somewhat neglected by most so-called enterprise software development shops and teams and is mostly relevant to industrial and embedded software development. Its premise is that automated testing is best done by generating test cases from a formal model or specification of the system under test. The model is expected to be more declarative, more compact and generally easier to write than its implementation while at the same time being machine-checked.</p>
<p>This book explains various techniques from the field using concrete case studies and software examples to explain test derivation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>xUnit Patterns</em>, G.Meszaros, Addison-Wesley, 200?</p>
<p>This large book is a complete catalog of <em>unit tests smells</em> and <em>patterns</em> Using the classical pattern format - motivation, strengths and weaknesses, contexts, details - it covers all kind of tests one can automate with xUnit tools, from pure function testing to database testing integration testing.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided By Tests</em>, S.Freeman and N.Pryce, Addison-Wesley, 2010</p>
<p>Another excellent book providing a detailed picture of modern software development, inspired by eXtreme Programming, from a developer’s point of view. It explains in details how and when to integrate various levels of testing in the development process, from broad brush architectural design to short TDD cycles writing implementation code. It is also replete with lot of advices, war stories, use cases and anti-patterns that can be applied immediately for developing code.</p></li>
<li><em>Metrics and Models in Sofware Quality Engineering</em>, 2nd Ed, S.Kan, Addison-Wesley, 2003</li>
<li><p><em>Quality Software Management</em>, G.Weinberg, 4 vol.</p>
<p>A masterpiece from one of the influential gurus of software project management. QSM is not directly concerned with the <em>quality of software</em> per se but rather with the <em>quality of the management</em> of software development process. Rooted in the systemic tradition and drawing from the author’s experience in consulting, it offers a scientific and empirical approach to practitioners wishing to improve the quality of delivered software which obviously depends heavily on the quality of the <strong>process</strong> which produces the software.</p>
<p>First volume explains <em>System thinking</em> and classifies organizations in 5 levels of maturity - something very reminiscent of what Capability MAturity Model is, explaining how these different organization tackle the complexity of delivering software and which kind of systems they produce. This volume is particularly interesting as it offers a method for analyzing and understanding problems and systems through drawing <em>effect diagrams</em>.</p>
<p>Second volume deals with <em>First Order Measurement</em>, or how to manage effectively a process through metrics. It emphasizes the human nature of software development and as such the futility of building and using complex and very precise measures. Every metrics is likely to be “gamed” by the people within the system, so better make them lightweight, easily changed and understood, with clear and precise goals.</p>
<p>Third volume is targeted at managers and deals with <em>Congruent Action</em>: How to manage the software development process in order to improve it.</p>
<p>Fourth volume is more strategic and deals with <em>Anticipating Changes</em> of the software and the process.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Exploratory Testing Explained</em>, J.Whittaker, Addison-Wesley, 2010</p>
<p>Google’s chief tester explains what <em>exploratory testing</em> is and how to apply it effectively using the <em>Tour</em> metaphor</p></li>
