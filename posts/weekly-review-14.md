This post is a summary of links related to coding and software I followed and read (sometimes, skimmed over) in the past week. Its purpose is both to serve as a high-level personal log and as a potential source of interesting (or not so interesting) links. Entries are provided in no particular order with minimal comments…

[Exrm Releases · Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/v0.13.1/docs/advanced-deployment)

: While pairing with Bernard on Barrel we investigated how to package applications built in Elixir

[Magit User Manual](https://magit.vc/manual/magit.html#Getting-Started)

: A gentle reminder that magit rocks and I should be using it.

[ElixirCheat12 - ElixirCheat.pdf](https://media.pragprog.com/titles/elixir/ElixirCheat.pdf)

: Elixir's syntax is quite easy to grasp thanks to its proximity with Ruby, but there are quite a few details I am not familiar with.

[PumpkinDB](http://pumpkindb.org/)

: A "new" database focusing on providing good foundations for Event Sourced applications. Interestingly, it uses a dialect of [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) language to express queries and operations to be run in the DB Engine.

[Certified Programming with Dependent Types | The MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/certified-programming-dependent-types)

: Looks like this could be a good read given my current strong interest in dependently typed languages. Uses Coq but I suspect this could be equally applicable to Agda and Idris.

[Programmable Infrastructure Needs Testing Too - OpenCredo](https://opencredo.com/programmable-infrastructure-needs-testing/)

: Good reminder that we should apply the good things we have learnt the hard way from programming when treating *infrastructure as code*: Test-Driven Development is equally meaningful, if a bit harder to implement. Infrastructure and configuration management is another area where type-driven development shines.

[TyDe 2017](http://tydeworkshop.org/2017)

: If I were still doing research, one workshop I would love to apply for.

[Sinclair ZX-81 computer](http://oldcomputers.net/zx81.html)

: My first computer...

[Salon des Refusés 2017 - ‹Programming› 2017](http://2017.programmingconference.org/track/refuses-2017#modal-phid_545469060e55a2083d899855b00321c4)

: Thanks to @[abolibibelot](https://twitter.com/abolibibelot), this conference's page provides a wealth of interesting and/or puzzling links on programming

[Syntactor](https://gregoor.github.io/syntactor/)

: Even if the idea of enhancing code editors to take care of the syntactic structure is not new and has not yet blossomed, this implementation is a good reminder this could be a great tool if done properly

[Scène VIII](http://lettres.ac-rouen.fr/archives_bac/annales/a71.html)

: Sometimes feeling like Cyrano...

[Pourquoi tant de profs ne supportent plus Céline Alvarez? | Slate.fr](http://www.slate.fr/story/125493/celine-alvarez)

: [Céline Alvarez](https://www.celinealvarez.org/) has reached celebrity in 2016 thanks to her book on education, drawn from an experiment she ran for 3 years in Aubervilliers. She has attracted a lot of criticism from professional teachers. It seems to me the relationship between the kind of education she promotes and what it is for 99% of the people is akin to the relationship between what software development is like at companies like Google and what it is for the rest of us...

[BrownBagLunch](http://www.brownbaglunch.fr/)

: Added myself to Nantes' baggers

[Color Intelligence - PANTONE Fashion Color Report Spring 2017](https://www.pantone.com/fashion-color-report-spring-2017)

: @[\_\_MaxS\_\_](https://twitter.com/__MaxS__) provided some feedback on the use of colors on [Dr.Code](http://drcode.io) and I discovered Pantone issued quarterly reports on which colors are *trending*! Yet having a good palette does not help you much if you lack any kind of design skill...

[Roue chromatique | Modèles de couleurs - Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/fr/create/color-wheel/)

: Another site to make nice color palettes. Same remark applies here!

[Programming is Writing is Programming - writing.pdf](https://refuses.github.io/preprints/writing.pdf)

: A good read from the already mentioned *Salon des refusés*. Advocates how close to writing programming is, which implies we programmers should take care of styling issues.

[creationism.pdf](https://refuses.github.io/preprints/creationism.pdf)

: Another somewhat puzzling read from the *Salon des refusés*. If you are into Social Darwinism and Libertarianism...

[Code is not just text – Gregor – Medium](https://medium.com/@grgtwt/code-is-not-just-text-1082981ae27f)

: Yet another link from the *Salon des refusés*

[Faré's Home Page - François-René Rideau - Đặng-Vũ Bân](http://fare.tunes.org/)

: Home page of the "Creationism" paper's author.

[Literate Programming and Eve](http://witheve.com/deepdives/literate.html)

: Eve is an experimental language and IDE that "*presents an alternative take on what programming could be*". I have always been attracted to such kind of tools that propose to mix text, layout and code, in the spirit of literate programming and [notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

[puffnfresh/tryidris: Try Idris](https://github.com/puffnfresh/tryidris)

: An online sandbox to try Idris. Can even compile to Javascript.

[tfjmp/php2uni: PHP2Uni](https://github.com/tfjmp/php2uni)

: Alternative approach to building unikernels from "standard" languages

[Things I Learned Managing Site Reliability for Some of the World’s Busiest Gambling Sites | zwischenzugs](https://zwischenzugs.wordpress.com/2017/04/04/things-i-learned-managing-site-reliability-for-some-of-the-worlds-busiest-gambling-sites/)

: Good read on the importance of process and documentation for operations.
