This post is a summary of links related to coding and software I followed and read (sometimes, skimmed over) in the past week. Its purpose is both to serve as a high-level personal log and as a potential source of interesting (or not so interesting) links. Entries are provided in no particular order with minimal comments…

# 2017-04-24 Monday

[LinuxKit operating system built for container](https://gianarb.it/blog/linuxkit-operating-system-build-for-containers)

: A new and experimental tool from the Docker team to build OSes using containers (or container images ?) that you can deploy to different targets. Seems to be a contender in the [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) or [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) space...

[Compiling to categories (extended version) - compiling-to-categories.pdf](http://conal.net/papers/compiling-to-categories/compiling-to-categories.pdf)

: A paper about using categorical language (or more precisely [Cartesian Closed Categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_closed_category)) as a common *assembly* for expressions and programs that can be fed to specific interpreters. I did not read it in full but this reminds me of work from the 80s and 90s on Caml compiler and the [Categorical Abstract Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_abstract_machine). Looks definitely exciting!

[jwiegley/z3cat: Use Conal Elliott's concat library to compile regular Haskell functions into Z3 equations](https://github.com/jwiegley/z3cat)

: Everything's in the title, I guess.

[Summoning Genius | Live In Greatness - core protocols for shared vision](https://liveingreatness.com/summoning-genius/)

: Core protocols have always fascinated me since I have been introduced to them by Christophe Thibaut. This text is part of the same site and is an appeal to live up to one's own dreams and "live in greatness".

[Évolution technique et objectivité technique chez Leroi-Gourhan et Simondon](https://appareil.revues.org/580#tocto1n4)

: A philosophy article related to the topic of the talk I am preparing fro nCrafts

[One Sinister Hurricane.pdf](https://geography.arizona.edu/sites/geography.arizona.edu/files/u122/One%2520Sinister%2520Hurricane.pdf)

: An ANT-inspired analysis of work done to create visualisation tools for hurricanes' effects. Provides evidence on the way technical tools shape thinking and interaction.

[Temps et individuations technique, psychique et collective dans l’œuvre de Simondon](http://intellectica.org/SiteArchives/archives/n26_27/26_09_Stiegler.pdf)

: Started to read that one because it mentions Simondon, but I must confess Stiegler's prose is more often than not opaque to me.

[Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry](http://www.rem.ufpr.br/_REM/REMv4/vol4/arti-palombini.htm)

: Not sure... 

[A CITY IS NOT A TREE](http://en.bp.ntu.edu.tw/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/06-Alexander-A-city-is-not-a-tree.pdf)

: A well-known text from Christophe Alexander that rejects the use of the *tree* model for cities in favor of *graphs* (he does not use that word and speaks instead of *lattices*).

# 2017-04-25 Tuesday

[Copying & Repetition – Zed A. Shaw](https://zedshaw.com/2017/04/24/copying-repetition/)

: On the importance of repetition and *rote learning*.

[What is it that we 'do', when we perform an action? - Praxis and Poiesis](https://sites.google.com/site/praxisandtechne/Home/architecture/performativity/poiesis-and-praxis)

: On the difference between *poeisis* (action driven by some goal) and *praxis* (action which is its own goal)

[LATOUR’S “JAMESIAN” EMPIRICISM (2): the case of prepositions](https://terenceblake.wordpress.com/2013/10/29/latours-jamesian-empiricism-2-the-case-of-prepositions/)

: Interesting criticism on Latour's (ab)use of William James' empiricism.

[The Case Against Reality - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/the-illusion-of-reality/479559/?utm_source%3Dtwb)

: A "scientific" argument that reality is not what we think it is. I put scientific in double-quotes because obviously, this theory hardly lends itself to falsifiability. Some more links on the same topic:

    * [The Evolutionary Argument Against Reality | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160421-the-evolutionary-argument-against-reality/)
    * [Is Donald Hoffman’s interface theory of perception true? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-Donald-Hoffman%25E2%2580%2599s-interface-theory-of-perception-true)
    * [Michael Shermer Perception Deception » Michael Shermer](http://www.michaelshermer.com/2015/11/perception-deception/#more-4721)
    * [Donald D. Hoffman | University of California, Irvine](http://cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/publications/): Contains original scientific articles presenting Hoffman's theory in greater details

[relation between type theory and category theory in nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/relation%2Bbetween%2Btype%2Btheory%2Band%2Bcategory%2Btheory)

: A site that looks ladden with complex stuff on cats and dependent types.
