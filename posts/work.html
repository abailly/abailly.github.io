<h1>On “Work”</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">A History of How We Spend Our Time</h2>
<div class="info">Posted on 2022-01-14</div>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/work-9781526604996/">Work</a>
is a book by James Suzman which seems to be a popular version of his
academic works.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>The book starts by exposing the relationship between <em>work</em> in
the physical sense, eg. transformation of energy, and <em>work</em> in
the human sense. Work appears to be something that is characteristic of
all life forms: Life is about extracting energy from the environment in
order to sustain an organism. More and more complex life forms evolved
through more and more efficient energy extractions capabilities, from
the primitive chemical absorption of unicellulars to photosynthesis, to
parasites, to plant grazers, to meat eaters… Eating more evolved life
forms that already have extracted and refined energy from other sources
is more efficient. Omnivorous animals dominate the “ecosphere” as they
are able to extract energy from a wider variety of sources, and humanity
made a leap through the discovery of <em>fire</em> which allowed humans
to become even more efficient energy harvester.</p>
<p>But life is also about <em>spending</em> energy. Most lifeforms spend
100% of their energy on basic needs: Looking for food, mating,
reproducing, but it’s not always the case: Suzman gives one detailed
example of a south african bird that spends a great deal of its time
building intricate nests that are not used. Living in an bountiful
environment from which it can easily feed itself gives it more “free
time” to spend energy on “useless” matters. Other examples abound and
testify for <a href="./origin-of-species.html">Darwin’s</a> <em>sexual
selection</em> principle: It’s not enough to be the “fittest”, one has
also to reproduce successfully and it’s perfectly possible that species
evolve seemingly useless characters that provide an advantage for mating
and reproduction.</p>
<p>Suzman spent lot of time living with and studying what is left of the
Khoisan (aka. Bushmen). They are the closest approximation to how our
ancestors would have been living, they have been around for 10s of 1000s
of years and barely changed their way of life. Khoisan are
hunter-gatherers that feed from a somewhat hostile, arid environment,
yet it’s been estimated they “work” about 3-4 hours per day maximum,
more often less. They do not accumulate food nor any kind of goods and
their society is fiercely egalitarian: The rich are mocked and anyone
can ask anyone else to give him or her something they own, which
guarantees quick equalisation and distribution of any kind of riches</p>
<p>From the work of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_affluent_society">Marshall
Sahlins</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott">James C. Scott</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Clastres">Pierre
Clastres</a> and others, we now know “primitive” societies have been
much more affluent than the Western narrative usually asserted it. There
are a lot of archaelogical evidences from the early days of humanity
showing that people were doing something else than gathering food,
engaging into production of art, crafts, and probably a lot of purely
social activities that leave no trace. Humans, like all living beings,
don’t seem to like staying idle hence “work” has a natural tendency to
fill time. We don’t even know what the omnipresent <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_axe">Hand-axe</a> was used for,
but we know it required training, time and skill to be done
properly.</p>
<p>It’s not clear at what point society became unegalitarian, there are
tombs showing differences in wealth before agriculture, but it’s clear
agriculture raised significantly the amount of work people had to do to
sustain themselves especially as in the early days, agriculture was
inefficient, dangerous, bread epidemics… See <a
href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300182910/against-grain">Against
the grain</a> for more thorough discussion on the “Agriculture
revolution” narrative. It’s not even clear that agriculture in and of
itself breeds inequality as there are evidences of egalitarian farming
societies, and even egalitarian city dwellers like in Çatalhöyük.</p>
<p>The second half of the book is devoted to how our urban, highly
mechanised, energy hungry society came into being, from the early days
of agriculture with archeologic findings in Palestine and fertile
crescent. Agriculture was a revolution that took time to take off but
fundamentally changed our relationship to work and our environment:
Agriculture made the concept of <em>delayed returns</em> central to the
life of the first farmers, whereas HG societies were built around
<em>immediate returns</em>. Whereas in the latter case, man is
<em>part</em> of an environment that profusely provides everything
that’s needed for him to strive, and no more, in the former the
environment becomes the <em>nature</em>, an external source of food,
wealth, resources and energy that must be worked on, harvested,
accumulated, invested.</p>
<p>Humanity’s relationship to its environment became more and more
<em>instrumental</em>, nature was objectified and contrasted with
<em>culture</em> whereas the hunter-gatherer societies had a symbiotic
relationship with their environment.</p>
<p>Then Suzman draws from the work of Malthus, Keynes, Sahlins, Taylor
to demonstrate how this fundamental shift turned <em>scarcity</em> as a
central driver of our lives. Malthus “proved” that infinite growth was
unsustainable because productivity of the land would grow linearly where
population grows exponentially. Technical progress disproved his
predictions for a couple of centuries, until the growth of fossile
energy consumption has thrown the climate into a trajectory that could
prove fatal to humanity.</p>
<p>During the XIXth century and the first half of the XXth, continuous
improvement in productivity lead to a decrease in the amount of time
people spent working, from 70-80 hours a week in the early days of
industrial revolution, to about 40 hours. Keynes predicted this fall
would continue thanks to increasing mechanisation but he was proven
wrong: Since the 70s, work time has stagnated or even slightly increased
again, esp. in the U.S and since the 1980s, inequalities in the
distribution of wealth (and revenue) have also increased drastically as
documented notably by <a
href="https://www.seuil.com/ouvrage/le-capital-au-xxie-siecle-thomas-piketty/9782021082289">Piketty’s
work</a>.</p>
<p>Work has become a central part of our lives to the point it mostly
defines us (the first thing 2 strangers talk about when introduced to
each other is the work they do), yet this should not be considered
“normal” or a necessity: It’s a consequence of the industrial
revolution, that was made possible by increasing yield of farming and
increasingly energy efficient machines, which in turn created an
increasingly complex economic system and society.</p>
<p>Durkheim founded sociology in order to better understand this complex
system, which lead him to study the “malady of infinite aspiration” or
<em>anomie</em>. Work has become something we do <em>in order to</em> do
something else, a mean to an end, a way to earn money that we can spend
consuming things we have been producing in the first place, but
indirectly. Contrary to what classical economists like Smith, Malthus
and others thought, scarcity might not be a consequence of the infinite
desires of men and their growing numbers pitted against limited
resources, but rather this “infinite aspiration” is a consequence of
modern conditions of living.</p>
<p>Scarcity, greed and the absurd accumulation of wealth they generate,
are then a by product of our civilisation, not its foundation.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I’m having a hard time summarizing the core idea of this book, what
really James Suzman is after. The second half of the book which delves
into the more modern history of (Western) societies sounds somewhat like
it adopts a moralist’s stance, a criticism of modernity’s appetite for
work and unlimited growth that is all too easily contrasted with the
ascetic yet joyful way of life of hunter-gatherer tribes like the
Khoisan, or what we know from archaeological evidences. The first half,
which exposes findings and evidences from still existing
hunter-gatherers societies, is the most interesting one as it questions
the narrative around primitives, the superiority of <em>Homo
Sapiens</em>, and the take-off that agriculture permitted.</p>
