<h1 id="rock-solid-haskell-services">Rock-Solid Haskell Services</h1>
<ul>
<li>The workshop is presented by Roman Gonzales who is working for FP Complete and it leverages the company’s experience building highly-reliable services in Haskell</li>
<li>The overall architecture of the system is based on Matt Parson’s <a href="http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/03/22/three_layer_haskell_cake.html">Three Layer Haskell Cake</a>, which is very reminiscent of Alistair Cockburn’s Hexagonal Architecture and DDD</li>
<li>It boils down to enforcing a strict separation between <em>resources</em>, <em>business services</em> and <em>core domain logic</em></li>
<li>To those 3 layers, Roman, drawing from his experience as a Clojure developer, adds a <em>Zero Layer</em> which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of <em>components</em> in such a way that they can be disposed of and <em>restarted</em> at will. This gives the developer the ability to interact with the “complete” system directly in the REPL and be able to reload any part of it at will</li>
<li>The <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/componentm">componentm</a> library provides the needed tools for this, and the ability to report failures at startup/teardown time, as well as some timings on how much time each component took to startup and teardown. Note that I am slightly annoyed that all logging done happens to be text-based which to me seems like an anti-pattern: Logging issued at the application level should be structured and only ever converted to human-readable format when it is needed</li>
<li>Of course the greatest benefit of this approach is the shortening of the feedback loop it provides</li>
<li>Roman spends quite a long time presenting another tool he wrote to manage configuration, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/etc">etc</a>.</li>
<li><code>etc</code> allows one to define a lot of different sources of configuration like files, env variables, command-line flags, and merge them in a single JSON tree that can then be used by the application</li>
<li>I must say I am not a big fan of those big Yaml configurtion files although I must confess I sometimes indulge in them</li>
<li>Following a discussion with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/cvogt">Chris Vogt</a>, I more and more like the idea of limiting configuration to the bare minimum, e.g. to 0</li>
<li>Having non configurable executables that are produced and packaged for specific environment, which means moving the configuration up the stack, say at compile time</li>
<li>when we need to change some dependency, we recompile a process and redeploy it</li>
<li>this implies a solid deployment strategy and thec capability to rollback on errors</li>
<li>need to couple that with supervision trees in order to manage errors in an orderly manner</li>
<li>the presenter then introduces <a href="https://github.com/roman/Haskell-capataz">capataz</a> which is a Haskell implementation of <em>supervision</em> trees</li>
<li>supervision trees provide the ability to automatically restart components or components trees when an error happens</li>
<li>the workshop proceeds to deployment and production concerns, with <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/mnee2/release-it-second-edition">Release It!</a> as a reference pooint, and some definitions on various issues that can happen to a system:</li>
<li><em>impulses</em> are rapid shocks to the system</li>
<li><em>strain</em> is stress over time, which might be caused by dependency on another system that starts operating at half-capacity
<ul>
<li>signs are unresponsive app, spikes on system-level metrics, excess I/O</li>
</ul></li>
<li>strain produce <em>Cracks</em> that can lead <em>cascading failures</em></li>
<li><em>faults</em> =&gt; <em>errors</em> =&gt; <em>failures</em></li>
<li>source of strains:</li>
<li>lack of timeouts on outbound requests</li>
<li>resource pools drained because of failures at lower level</li>
<li>system resource exhaustion (files, ports, RAM…)</li>
<li>not limiting size of resources (bounded queues)</li>
<li>limiting size of query results</li>
<li>timeouts are very rarely transient which means retries should be delayed</li>
<li><em>circuit breakers</em> allow keeping track of the state of a 3rd party system</li>
<li>when num of failures pass some threshold -&gt; make all subsequent requests fail or return default value, marking the circuit open</li>
<li>after some time -&gt; try again (canary requests) and close the circuit again if it succeeds (e.g. 3rd party system goes back to normal state)</li>
<li>use timeouts on every use of allocated resource</li>
<li>the last stage of the workshop goes to deploying all the services that have bben built. The presenter introduces (localstack)[https://localstack.cloud/] a tool to simulate part of AWS stack locally.</li>

<h1 id="from-zero-to-live-with-functional-javascript">From Zero to Live with Functional Javascript</h1>
<p>This 2 hours workshop was given by Ian Thomas, CTO of SkyBet. It was a fast-paced overview on how to build modern javascript applications based on FP principles. The workshop is based on his <a href="https://github.com/anatomic/zero-to-live-fp-js-workshop">git repo</a> and builds a complete 12 factor app from the ground up. It contains lot of materials and the session was way too short to get more than a glimpse of it, but it’s definitely interesting material when one wants to build JS-based microservices.</p>
<p>Ian Thomas also gave a keynote on how FP helps break the <em>fear cycle</em> which prevents large code bases from changing.</p>
<h1 id="seeking-refuge-from-unsafe-javascript">Seeking Refuge from Unsafe JavaScript</h1>
<p>Another workshop dedicated to Functional Javascript, presented by David Chambers. It goes through the various pure FP constructs provided by <a href>sanctuary</a>, a library which basically provides Haskell on top of JS. Sanctuary provides algebraic data types and all the classical functions we have come to love from Haskell, and more.</p>
