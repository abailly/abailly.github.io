<h1>Some Notes on ML in Haskell following MLWeek</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on 2015-11-06</div>

<p>From Monday 2/11 to Thursday 5/11 I attended <a
href="http://www.ml-week.com/fr">ML Week</a>, a training session lead by
<a href="http://jeff.purple.com/qr/">Jeff Abrahamson</a> who also
organizes the <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/fr/Nantes-Machine-Learning-Meetup/">Nantes
ML Meetup</a>. This session was great, not only because of its content,
mostly an overview of the main techniques available and a hands-on dive
into Python’s eco-system to support data analysis, but also because of
the discussions we had with other attendees and with Jeff whose depth of
knowledge on the subject is truely amazing.</p>
<p>However I was a bit frustrated of not being able to epxlorer the
topic using my language of choice, namely Haskell. So I took opportunity
of this training to start collecting links and ideas on how to do data
analysis and ML in Haskell. Here are a few links and comments on my
attempts to <em>map</em> the tools we were using in Python to equivalent
things in the Haskell eco-system:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the hands-on codelabs for the training were provided in the form
of <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebooks</a>, so
I went to install <a
href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell">IHaskell</a> which provides
a Haskell <em>kernel</em> for notebooks. It works great straight out of
the box, I only had some minor glitches with <a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Chart">Charts</a> display. I
must say that the community for IHaskell is very responsive!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kronosnotebook.com/haskell">Kronos</a> provides
a packaged interactive data visualization tool that contains everythign
that’s needed to run IHaskell out-of-the-box when you dont’ want to
bother with installing Haskell eco-system,</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cassava">cassava</a>
provides type-safe parsing of CSV data,</li>
<li>There is a base statistics package for Haskell:
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/statistics, which is maintained by
Brian O’Sullivan who is also behind <a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wreq">wreq</a>, the one-stop
shop for making HTTP clients. This package among many other stuff
provides linear regression,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mikeizbicki/HLearn">HLearn</a> is an
ambitious project to provide efficient pure Haskell implementations of
various standard ML algorithms,</li>
<li>Basic matrices operations are provided by <a
href="http://dis.um.es/~alberto/hmatrix/hmatrix.html">hmatrix</a> which
is based on efficient routines implemented by LAPACK, BLAS, and
GSL,</li>
<li><a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hstatistics">hstatistics</a>
is another statistics package based on hmatrix,</li>
<li>There is a very interesting series of post from Dominik Steinitz:
The ones I have been particularly interested in are on <a
href="https://idontgetoutmuch.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/regression-and-automated-differentiation-4/">linear</a>
and <a
href="https://idontgetoutmuch.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/logistic-regression-and-automated-differentiation-3/">logistic</a>
regressions using <em>automatic differentiation</em>. There has been
some code drift in AD since the posts were written so they don’t compile
as-is using latest versions of libraries but modifications are
minor,</li>
<li>I thus turned to <a
href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ad-3.4">ad</a> package by
E.Kmett which happens to contain a routine for computing directly
approximations of functions through gradient descent techniques,</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/chatter">chatter</a>
implements some “standard” NLP algorithms which we had to deal with to
implement a spam detector,</li>
<li>Support Vector Machines support in Haskell is implemented in a
couple of packages:
<ul>
<li>There are <a
href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-svm">haskell
bindings</a> to the (apparently) state-of-the-art library <a
href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">libsvm</a> which is
what is used by scikit-learn,</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/svm">svm</a> is another
package which seems a bit oldish and unmaintained,</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I don’t think there is a compelling implementation of general
purpose neural networks of any kind, although there appear to be quite a
few package dealing with those beasts on hackage,</li>
<li>There are two libraries for computing K-means, both pretty recent:
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/kmeans-vector">kmeans-vector</a>,</li>
<li><a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/kmeans">kmeans</a>,</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For Principal Component Analysis, there is <a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hstatistics-0.2.5.3/docs/Numeric-Statistics-PCA.html">hstatistics</a>
or <a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix-nipals">hmatrix-nipals</a></li>
</ul>
