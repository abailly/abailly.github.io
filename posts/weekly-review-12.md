This post is a summary of my activities related to coding and software in the past week. Its purpose is both to serve as a high-level personal log and as a potential source of interesting (or not so interesting) links. Entries are provided in no particular order with minimal comments...

[Grammatical Framework](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/)

:   A fascinating piece of work whose purpose is to provide a way to define unified grammars that can be "linearized" into different languages for the purpose of both parsing and text generation.

[Emacs Daemon on Mac OS X](https://korewanetadesu.com/emacs-on-os-x.html)

:   Configuration for running Emacs in server mode which is useful for fast editing of files from the command-line: Run `emacsclient foo.txt&` and the file's content is displayed in a buffer in emacs. 

[La lutte pour la reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Honneth)

:   Finished reading this book from Axel Honneth, a German philosopher heir to the Frankfurt School. Worthy of some extended blog post...

[Capture org-mode links in Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/org-mode-capture/)

:   A nice utility to quickly capture links in Firefox and add them to Emacs' org-mode

[Huggin](https://github.com/cantino/huginn) 

:   A tool in Rails to create and manage agents on a personal server, something I have been thinking to setup for a while.

[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)

:   Open-source system to synchronize several devices

[Types + Properties = Software - Mark Seemann on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/162036084)

:   While working on my talk for [Crafting Software](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Crafting-Software/events/238241119/) meetup, I discovered previous work from Mark Seeman in the same vein. There is a whole blog post series on [Types + Properties = Software](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2016/02/10/types-properties-software/) which is definitely interesting. Inspired [The Polyglot Approach to Getting Better at Modeling the State and Writing Property Tests in Elm · Exceptional Mirrors](http://mirrors.link/posts/the-polyglot-approach-to-modeling-state-and-property-tests-in-elm) written in Elm.

[Reverse, Reverse: Theorem Proving with Idris](https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/reverse-reverse-theorem-proving-with-idris)

:   A blog post on how theorem proving works in Elm, detailing the classical vector reversal function's derivation.

[idris-tutorial.pdf](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/utgp/school/idris-tutorial.pdf)

:  A short tutorial on Idris by Edwin Brady. Not sure how relevant it is to the newest versions of the language, but provides a compact overview of Idris' features.

[Agda Tutorial](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/afp08/tutorial.pdf)

:   Working on Idris led me to [Agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) which is a predecessor of Idris with an emphasis on theorem proving.

[How can I express range validity in Idris?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42974540/how-can-i-express-range-validity-in-idris)

:  As I was struggling on writing some Idris code for my talk, I posted this question on SO which leads to a Ah!Ah! moment thanks to the answer it received: The slogan is *Add more information to your types*!

[Type Theory and Functional Programming](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TTFP/ttfp.pdf)

:   An out-of-print book by Simon Thompson (author of one of the first Haskell books) that seems to provide a lot of insights on top of Pierce's classical textbook.

[Brutal {Meta}Introduction to Dependent Types in Agda](http://oxij.org/note/BrutalDepTypes/)

:  A page full of resources on dependent types, not only in Agda. Lead me to  [this post](http://augustss.blogspot.fr/2007/10/simpler-easier-in-recent-paper-simply.html) from Lennart Augustsson which gives an implementation of a depedently-typed lambda calculus in Haskell.

[Wardley Maps](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/finding-a-path-cdb1249078c0#.32oohi27s)

:  I have started again to read Simon Wardley's book-in-progress on how to draw maps for strategic thinking.
