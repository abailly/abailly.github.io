This post is a summary of links related to coding and software I followed and read (sometimes, skimmed over) in the past week. Its purpose is both to serve as a high-level personal log and as a potential source of interesting (or not so interesting) links. Entries are provided in no particular order with minimal comments…

[Condorcet Internet Voting Service](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/proportional.html)

: An online implementation of Condorcet's voting system which uses voters' ranking to select the result which is the most acceptable for all voters. Maybe the result of French Presidential elections would be best modelled with such a system...

[A Neighborhood of Infinity: Cofree meets Free](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2014/05/cofree-meets-free.html)

[Self Contained Systems (SCS): Microservices Done Right](https://www.infoq.com/articles/scs-microservices-done-right)

: I am not a great fan of *XYZ done right* style of blog posts which have a natural tendency to decay over time. This one suggests a somewhat disciplined approach on microservices that is interesting.

[free.dvi - wadler.pdf](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~dreyer/course/papers/wadler.pdf)

: While preparing my talk, I thought this classical paper from Wadler could be a good example of *abstraction done right*! 

[On Free Monads – Pere Villega](http://perevillega.com/understanding-free-monads)

: An explanation (in Scala) of Free monads and what they are useful for

[Bits or pieces?: Adoption cycles](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2012/07/adoption-cycles.html)

A mettre en regard de [Travail : la révolution Remote – WillBe Group – Medium](https://medium.com/willbe-group/travail-la-r%25C3%25A9volution-remote-5ea29f32ad1a).

[Literate programming: Knuth is doing it wrong](http://akkartik.name/post/literate-programming)

: I stumbled upon this blog post while attending [Matthias Noback's session on Living Documentation](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/matthiasnoback). Literate programming would seem to make a lot of sense when one thinks about documenting software, yet it did not stick outside of academia. This post suggests improvements that could help literate programming go mainstream. This post lead me to [Wikilon](https://awelonblue.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/introducing-wikilon/) which appears to be some attempt at building an interactive programming system along the line of Bret Victor's [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming)

# 2017-05-20 Saturday

[Coeffects: Context-aware programming languages](http://tomasp.net/coeffects/)
