This post is a summary of my activities related to coding and software in the past week. Its purpose is both to serve as a high-level personal log and as a potential source of interesting (or not so interesting) links. Entries are provided in no particular order with minimal comments...

[Static Binaries for Haskell: A Convoluted Approach](https://vadosware.io/post/static-binaries-for-haskell-a-convoluted-approach/)

: When trying to build minimal docker images, having a statically linked binary is a plus. This is actually quite hard to realize in practice with GHC as this post demonstrates (note that I tried the suggested approach and failed...)

[graydon2 | "What next?"](http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html)

: Interesting and opinionated post on _what's next_ in Programming languages, e.g. which features from PLT will reach mainstream. First-class modules done right is definitely something we are direly in need for!


[Book Review: Surfing Uncertainty | Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/)

: A long book review on cognition and how our brain copes with uncertain, partial or plain wrong data.

[Les Protocoles Fondamentaux](https://github.com/adericbourg/coreprotocols-fr)

: French translation of Michelle and Jim McCarthy's [Core Protocols](), using [The Core Protocols: A Guide to Greatness](https://github.com/rkasper/coreprotocols) dfrom Richard Kasperowski as main source.

[FileCoin](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf)

: A _cryptocurrency_  providing blockchain-based file-system

[testing-feat: Functional Enumeration of Algebraic Types](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/testing-feat)

: A Haskell package to enumerate inhabitants of any ADT, useful for systematic testing of data types.

[Sam Coope - Blog](http://www.samcoope.com/posts/deep_code_generation)

: Looks fun! Did not read the full thesis though...

[PragPub January 2012 | Unit Tests Are FIRST | The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-01/unit-tests-are-first)

: A gentle reminder about the properties that a proper unit test should exhibit: Fast, Isolated, Repeatable, Self-Verifying, and Timely


[Tezos Crowdfunding](https://www.tezos.com/)

: Tezos is a smart contracts platform that aims at offering a self-governing network. I read the [language white paper](https://www.tezos.com/static/papers/white_paper.pdf) which interestingly draws ideas from Forth: The Tezos language is a typed stack-based language. Although of note is the fact the reference implementation is in OCaml.

[Bringing the web up to speed with WebAssembly | the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/18/bringing-the-web-up-to-speed-with-webassembly/)

: Speaking of languages, WebAssembly aims at providing a more solid foundation than Javascript as a the lingua franca for executing arbitrary code in browsers.
