: Another interesting post from *The Morning Paper*, this time about ethics and software. This resonates with some discussions we have had at latest Software Craft(wo)manship. Reading the paper I was attracted to ....

[Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong: Wendell Wallach, Colin Allen](https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Machines-Teaching-Robots-Right/dp/0199737975)

: ... but some reviews I read dettered me from buying it. I will try to dig into the subject a little bit more and look for some relevant texts (beside Kant, of course)

[Celui qui appuie sur le bouton est-il le seul coupable ?](/posts/simone-responsabilite.html) 

: My notes on the afternoon spent under the wise guidance of [Peggy Penet-Avez](http://peggyavez.com/) (aka. [Simone](http://simoneetlesphilosophes.fr/)) thinking my way across the concepts of intention, action, responsibilit, guilt...

[The Dada Engine](http://dev.null.org/dadaengine/)

: A well known post-modern articles generator. Stemmed from a discussion on the obscurity of Lacan which is the basis of [The Perverts' guide to computer programming](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vulk-blog/ThePervertsGuidetoComputerProgramming-ThePaper.pdf).

[DeepCoder: Learning to write programs](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/03/29/deepcoder-learning-to-write-programs/)

: Recurrent/Convolution neural networks that "learn" to write programs from input/output samples. Interestingly, the program generated are pure functional expressions...

: A huge set of links on system design

[Idris-dev/introduction.rst at master](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/master/docs/st/introduction.rst)

: A new Idris tutorial on the use of ST, a type for modelling state-machines.

[ExUnit v1.4.2](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.Case.html#describe/2)

: A deck on RuleML, a language to model business process rules 

[Nim Programming Language](https://nim-lang.org/)

[Magit tutorial? : spacemacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/comments/4a62la/magit_tutorial/)

: Not only did I have to program in Elixir (a dynamically typed language...), but I had to do it in Spacemacs! We found the experience to be somewhat painful because of some lag in pressing the `Esc` key, an issue which is solved by [this post](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/5413). Here is the final tmux configuration we use:

         set -g prefix C-a
         set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
         set -g mode-mouse on
         set -g mouse-resize-pane on
         set -g mouse-select-pane on
         set -g mouse-select-window on
         set -s escape-time 0
         set-option -g default-shell /bin/zsh
     
[Theory of existential types](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10753073/whats-the-theoretical-basis-for-existential-types)
