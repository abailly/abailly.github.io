# Why software is eating the world?

---

> Six decades into the computer revolution [..] all of the technology required to transform
> industries through software finally works and can be widely
> delivered at global scale.

> [Marc Andreessen](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/), 2011

::: notes

* Marc Andreessen is co-founder of Andreessen-Horowitz VC firm from the "Valley"
* Article is from 2011, 10 years after the dot.com bubble bust and argues the time is ripe to invest in software
* Due to higher connectivity (smartphones, fiber/cable providers, mobile networks) and availability of computing resources (eg. data centers, cloud computing), software company can effectively grow at a very high rate and secure market shares faster than in any other time in history
* Perfect high-modernist, capitalist stance

* of course it's a metaphor, but is a future driven by software desirable?

::: notes

* This is the portrait drawn by FBI of Unabomber, aka. Theodor Kaczynski
* Ted Kaczinsky wrote a well know manifesto entitled Industrial Society and Its Future

::: notes

* A manifesto highlighting the political impacts of software (and more generally technology centric) startups
* Latest in a long trend of books about the negative impact of technology

::: notes

* rise of a neo-luddite movement?
* BUT critics come mostly from the highly educated, tech-savvy, upper middle class
* people impacted by "software eating the world" (middle to low-class knowledge workers, clerks, office employees, low-wage delivery persons, uber drivers)  are not (at least explicitly) criticising it => they are users/consumers of the software!

# Crafts vs. Industry

## Arts & Crafts

![[Fabric pattern by William Morris](https://mymodernmet.com/arts-and-crafts-movement-william-morris/)](/images/arts-crafts.jpeg)

::: notes

* Could we take inspiration from William Morris (and others, like John Ruskin) Arts & crafts movement?
* A&C movement reacted against the "impoverishment" of the quality of life and "things" the industrial revolution brought
* It's interesting this movement arose at about the same time as various philosophical, political, and literary movements looking for a better understanding human experience (phenomenology, pragmatism)
* Also, this movement took place about a century after the Luddites

## Software Crafts(manship)

![[Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org)](/images/software-crafts-manifesto.png)

::: notes

* An early attempt at redefining programming around the ideas of Craftsmanship
* Note how the picture and the manifesto's name obviously winks at Morris' Arts & Crafts
* Like everything it's been recycled by the software industry as a poster child of considerate software development practices
* Emphasis on programming as a social activity
* Still Poiesis => focused on the gaol, the outcome, the end result
* Also Richard Sennett's [The
  Craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Craftsman_(book)) and
  [Matthew Crawford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Crawford)

# Poiesis & Praxis

## Programming for its own sake

* Dialogic _and_ Dialectic process
* Writing _and_ Interpreting simultaneously
* Programs defeat classical _hylemorphic scheme_, they are
  individualities *emerging* from the programming process

::: notes

* against hylemorphism -> shape vs. matter, design vs. coding

## Programming for its own sake

![Programming is Manual too](/images/keyboards.jpg)

## Low-tech Software

![[100 Rabbits Collective](https://100r.co/site/home.html)](/images/hundred-rabbits.png)

::: notes

* An alternative approach to computing and programming, mixing digital arts, environmentalism, hacktivism
* Living off-the-grid on a boat, low waste and carbon footprint
* Decentralised network of low-powered devices
* Build portable systems and tools

:::

## Low-tech Software

![Sample Applications in Uxntal](/images/uxn.png)

::: notes

* put the programmer back in control
* real _full-stack_ programmer
* decentralised/intermittently connected network of humans collaborating
* programming as tool making

:::

## Future of Programming

* Programming is **neither** _art_, nor _science_ or _math_, nor even _engineering_, _writing_, _craft_, _game_
* (One) future of programming is _Programming as Praxis_
* [_When I program, I program_](https://www.site-magister.com/prepas/montess3.htm)

::: notes

* Montaigne: _Quand je danse, je danse_
* Software as a human experience
