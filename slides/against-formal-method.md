## Where do I speak from?

* Dev/Tech Lead/Architect/Consultant for 30+ years
* PhD in computer science (20 years ago)
* Dedicated _eXtreme Programming_ Practitioner
* Cautious believer in the benefits of formal methods
* Experience limited to _specific_ types of software

## Publication

![FUNARCH'2024](/images/funarch-paper.png)

::: notes

* personal take from this paper and own experience
* previously published paper at Workshop on Functional Architecture w/ James Chapman and Polina Vinogradova
* summarizes various other projects
* contains some findings and analysis shared here

:::

## Too Long; Didn't Read

To reap more benefits out of thems, _Formal Methods_ should:

* Become a first-class citizen of the software development process
* Get out of their current niche and specialized circles
* Better support modern software development practices like _Domain Driven Design_

::: notes

* better = build the software right + build the right software
* opinions and analysis are my own and are debatable

<strong>Formal methods are software too</strong>

# Context & Experience

## Cardano

A research-based proof-of-stake blockchain and cryptocurrency based
on _Ouroboros Praos_ protocol

![Ouroboros Praos](/images/praos-paper.png)

----

* Globally distributed and fully decentralized _open_ system
* 3000+ block producing nodes, 1M+ "wallets", 100s of _developers_ and _startups_
* Daily transactions amounting to 100s of millions USD
* _Security & safety are not an option_

::: notes

* not an endorsment of economic model or libertarian values

:::

## R&D Projects

* [Hydra](https://hydra.family): Isomorphic state channels for Cardano (aka. Layer 2)
* [Mithril](https://mithril.network): Stake-based multisigned snapshots
* [Peras](https://peras.cardano-scaling.org): Faster settlement for Ouroboros
* [Leios](https://leios.cardano-scaling.org): Higher throughput for Ouroboros

::: notes

* only list projects I have been personally involved with

<h4>**My job is to turn research papers into working software**</h4>

----

Common theme:

* More or less (more) complex algorithms and protocols w/ proven properties
* Written by cryptographic & security researchers, aka. _mathematicians_, with heavy proof apparatus
* Require collaboration of people with diverse background and skills

<!-- ## Hydra/Mithril -->

<!-- * No attempt at working with formal methods -->
<!-- * Heavy emphasis on Property-based testing & Test-driven development -->
<!-- * Used _some_ model-based testing approach -->
<!-- * After-the-fact formal specification in LaTeX -->

<!-- ---- -->

<!-- ![Hydra formalization](/images/hydra-formal-spec.png) -->

## Peras

* One project within _Innovation streams_
* Experiment and refine structured _method_ to go from research ideas to products
* Small (3.5 people) team: Researcher, FM engineer, 2 x Architects/Developers

::: notes

* Product is somewhat mising in the picture but let's not dive to deeply into this
* Method replicated for Leios projects

:::

## Process & Tools

![Peras workflow](/images/peras-process-simple.png)

----

* _Agda_: Formal specification language
* _Agda2HS_: Generate Haskell code from Agda specification
* _quickcheck-dynamic_: Haskell code to generate conformance tests
* _Haskell_ and _Rust_: Target languages for prototypes

## Agda formalisation

* Protocol modelled in Agda using [Small-steps semantics](https://peras.cardano-scaling.org/agda_html/Peras.SmallStep.html) specifying the impact of each node "actions" on global state
* Took inspiration from previous work on [Formalizing Nakamoto-Style Proof of Stake](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/917.pdf) in Coq

----

![Agda Specification](/images/peras-agda-spec.png)

## Peras conformance tests ðŸ’¡

* Write an executable model for testing purpose (_Agda_)
* Generate code suitable for use with _QuickCheck_
* Write [soundness proof](https://github.com/input-output-hk/peras-design/blob/main/src/Peras/Conformance/Soundness.agda) relating the two models

----

![Peras testing](/images/peras-conformance-testing.png)

<!-- ## Cardano-ledger conformance tests -->

<!-- * ðŸ’¡ Write an Agda model (specification) -->
<!-- * Generate Haskell code using standard MAlonzo "opaque" code generator -->
<!-- * Use generated model to test conformance of (Haskell) implementation -->

<!-- ## Outcome -->

<!-- https://tweag.github.io/cardano-peras/peras-design.pdf -->

# Findings

## Better standard

_Literate Agda_ formed the backbone of a [Cardano Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0140) standard specification.

![CIP-140](/images/peras-cip.png)

## Feedback loop

* Formalisation (and prototyping) uncovered shortcomings in the protocol that lead to improvements
* Interaction of formal modeling and prototyping uncovered a few bugs in _both_
* Having a "small" formal model helped bootstrap [development beyond prototyping](https://tweag.github.io/cardano-peras/peras-design.pdf)

## Towards a "Security Research" DSL

## Skills & specialization

* FM are rarely touched upon before graduate level
* Upskilling general purpose programmers to use FM takes time
* Even switching from one method to an other is non trivial

----

* FM work requires specialised skills and knowledge
* FM on the critical path of software development introduces delays
* _The DBA effect_
* _Ivory Tower_ architects

----

![Silos](/images/silo.jpeg)

## Tools & Process

* Most formal specifications are written once and rarely touched upon
* There's a plethora of tools and languages to choose from, each with its own (small) ecosystem
* Software necessarily evolves over time to suit the need for changing requirements, users, environment

----

![Coq Proof fragment](/images/pos-nsb-proof.png)

----

<h4>How do we keep formal specifications and FM artefacts maintenable over time?</h4>

----

* Tooling is not on par with tooling for general purpose programming languages
* "Market size" effect -> building tools for niche languages does not attract big players
* "PhD quality software" -> software written to support research ideas or projects, not "industrial" software

::: notes

* `agda2hs` is basically incompatible with `stdlib` -> they serve 2 different purposes
* it's not maintained by a dedicated team

:::

----

* Writing proofs for non-trivial properties is time consuming (took 4 months to prove soundness property for Peras)
* This time impacts total development cost

## Team & Organisation

On the research side:

* Researchers are not FM engineers
* Writing "Pen & paper" proofs is _very different_ from writing mechanized proofs in Agda or Coq
* How are we sure the formal specification matches the paper?

----

On the engineering side:

* _Collective code ownership_ require team-wide mastery of the whole development process
* How do we integrate FM in an iterative and incremental process?

# Conclusion

## It's just another _Domain_

![Relating Proofs & Programs](/images/proof-program.png)

----

* Researchers are domain experts whose ideas we want to turn into software
* _Domain Driven Design_ emerged in the past decade as a great (set of) tool for software development
* Creating and evolving an _Ubiquitous Language_ is a key ingredient in DDD

----

> Can Formal Methods be useful as a Better Ubiquitous Language?

## Call to action

* Need to improve tooling
* Teaching and training for "the rest of us"
* Gradual integration of FM in software lifecycle (work on small feature or components)
* Consolidation of the FM landscape
* Integration with LLM and generative AI?

## References & Links

* Peras [website](https://peras.cardano-scaling.org) and [code repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/peras-design) contain details about the project
